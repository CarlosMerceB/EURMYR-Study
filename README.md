# EURMYR-Study
EURMYR exchange rate study. Compared all the data from 2018 to December 2024 of EUR/MYR par and USD, MYR and EURO interest rates (effective)

#TL;DR: Exchange rate EUR/MYR is mainly moved because of EURO interest rates and not MYR ones as this has focus on USD movements 

#From 2018 to 2020 EUR was losing value against the MYR. During the pandemic, EURO rose around 13% mainly because, even with huge covid rstrictions and 
#interest rates from ECB close to 0, Malaysia was way more affected by COVID-19. 
#To sum up, it wen from 4.49 ringgit per EURO in February 2020 to 5.08 on May 2021

#From mid 2021 to September of 2022, the EURO made all the way back to its lowest point of the frame on 4.42 ringgit per EURO.

#Interest from  central banks (effective ones were used except for the MYR) began to rise in mid 2022.

#EURO was the latest on this move and so the tendency in exchange rate did not change till September 2022.

#Following this policy from central banks, the EUR/MYR peaked on February 2024 to 5.17 and suddenly
#started a decline because of cut in interest rates.

#We can see that the main driver is the European Short Term Rate, this is the key indicator of the tendencies in the EUR/MYR

#Having read Malaysian Central Bank sheets and others references. Malaysia keeps its focus on the USA and USD movements. That's
#why they might go behind in its monetary policies and thats why those not fully align with the EUR/MYR
